                                        cultivated a fast-paced, agile development environment where
                                        creativity and teamwork are paramount.</p>
                                        <p>You are someone who prefers to communicate through code.
                                            You love to create and have a strong desire to learn.
                                            You have strong opinions yet know how to implement them;
                                            you are humble yet confident. In fact, you‚Äôre the first
                                            to pass along the latest headache busting library from
                                            Square to your colleagues just minutes after sending a
                                            link to a mind clarifying blog post from Romain Guy.</p>
                                        <p>You can speak to language best practices and are not
                                            afraid of anonymous inner-classes. You never overlook
                                            the saved instance state and have contemplated the
                                            tradeoffs between activities, fragments and views. You
                                            have knowledge of how a RESTful web service works, what
                                            makes it RESTful and how it can be accessed from
                                            Android. You are also diligent about meeting allocated
                                            budgets and can work within time constraints, but you
                                            will never sacrifice quality.</p>

                                            problems of our time, we can create a future where there
                                            is limitless freedom of movement for people and things
                                            all across the world. Just talk to our people ‚Äî and feel
                                            their passion, optimism and curiosity for building
                                            solutions every single day on behalf of drivers, riders,
                                            couriers, eaters and employees.</p>
                                        <p>While these tough problems we face every day can be
                                            incredibly difficult to figure out, we believe those
                                            same problems enable us to personally grow the most. So
                                            we welcome people from all backgrounds who have the
                                            passion to change the world and also want to help create
                                            a supportive and collaborative environment. So that
                                            ultimately, we can learn together, solve together, build
                                            together, and move the world forward together.</p>
                                        <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                                        <p>Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium
                                            black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we‚Äôre a part
                                            of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around
                                            the world. Whether it‚Äôs a ride, a sandwich, or a
                                            package, we use technology to give people what they
                                            want, when they want it.</p>
                                        <p>For our drivers and couriers, the Uber app represents a
                                            flexible way to earn money. For cities and communities,
                                            we help strengthen local economies, improve access to
                                            transportation, and make streets safer. &nbsp;And we‚Äôre
                                            thinking about the future, too with teams working on
                                            autonomous trucking and self-driving vehicles.</p>

                                        <p>It‚Äôs tempting to want to join a company that looks like
                                            it has it all figured out<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>But
                                            those companies aren‚Äôt always the best place to learn.
                                            The truth is, the more problems a company has, the more
                                            opportunities there are to solve. And the more problems
                                            you solve, the more you learn. And the more you learn,
                                            the more you grow.</p>

                                            black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we‚Äôre a part
                                            of the logistical fabric of more than 500 cities around
                                            the world. Whether it‚Äôs a ride, a sandwich, or a
                                            package, we use technology to give people what they
                                            want, when they want it.</p>
                                        <p>For the women and men who drive with Uber, our app
                                            represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities,
                                            we help strengthen local economies, improve access to
                                            transportation, and make streets safer.</p>
                                        <p>And that‚Äôs just what we‚Äôre doing today. We‚Äôre thinking
                                            about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous
                                            trucking and self-driving cars, we‚Äôre in for the long
                                            haul. We‚Äôre reimagining how people and things move from
                                            one place to the next.</p>
                                        <p>About the Role</p>
                                        <p>We‚Äôre looking for experienced, passionate Android

                                            them from the opaque brokerage process, and offering

                                        <p>Uber Freight connects shippers with truck drivers, much
                                            like the way the Uber connects riders and drivers. The
                                            Uber Freight team believes that empowering truck drivers
                                            will bring more open, efficient, and increasingly safer
                                            transportation to our roads. We are a team of sharp,

                                        <p>Shopify is building an Android app that allows merchants
                                            to chat and interact with Kit - Shopify‚Äôs digital
                                            marketing assistant - and their customers in a native
                                            environment with a rich UI and deep functionality.</p>
                                        <p>As an engineer with a focus on mobile at Shopify you will
                                            work with other mobile engineers along with designers
                                            and product managers to build and launch new versions of
                                            our apps. You‚Äôll gain a ton of perspective as you
                                            connect with different teams that work on related parts
                                            of Shopify. You‚Äôll work on a large scale app that is
                                            ever changing, enabling entrepreneurship for hundreds of
                                            thousands of merchants. You‚Äôll be able to take the time
                                            to rebuild the areas that need love while some of your
                                            code stands the test of time. You‚Äôll grow and learn a

                                        <p>Shopify is building an Android app that allows merchants
                                            to chat and interact with Kit - Shopify‚Äôs digital
                                            marketing assistant - and their customers in a native
                                            environment with a rich UI and deep functionality.</p>
                                        <p>As an engineer with a focus on mobile at Shopify you will
                                            work with other mobile engineers along with designers
                                            and product managers to build and launch new versions of
                                            our apps. You‚Äôll gain a ton of perspective as you
                                            connect with different teams that work on related parts
                                            of Shopify. You‚Äôll work on a large scale app that is
                                            ever changing, enabling entrepreneurship for hundreds of
                                            thousands of merchants. You‚Äôll be able to take the time
                                            to rebuild the areas that need love while some of your
                                            code stands the test of time. You‚Äôll grow and learn a

                                        a few short months. Our product is innovative and fun, and
                                        it delivers the goods.</p>
                                        <p>Last year, we won the "App of the Year 2017" at the
                                            Google Play Awards in Mountain View. With near zero
                                            marketing spend we‚Äôve grown organically to tens of
                                            millions of users, and we‚Äôre already profitable with a
                                            team of around 70, speaking over 40 languages!</p>
                                        <p>We‚Äôre now looking to build out our engineering team to
                                            take Memrise to the next level. The goal in the coming

                                            brand in global language learning.</p>
                                        <p>We are looking for a Senior Android Engineer to join the
                                            team. Your mission will be to build and improve our
                                            Android app, and to help make Memrise the number one

                                            maintenance but will focus on building new features. We
                                            work in cross functional squads, which means you will be

                                            codebase is 5 years old but with strong foundations that
                                            we have total ownership of; our minSdk is 21, we use
                                            dagger2, Retrofit2, RxJava and we are moving to Kotlin
                                            in both unit tests and features.</p>

                                        <p>We‚Äôre changing the way people think about transportation.
                                            Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium
                                            black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we‚Äôre a part
                                            of the logistical fabric of more than 500 cities around
                                            the world. Whether it‚Äôs a ride, a sandwich, or a
                                            package, we use technology to give people what they
                                            want, when they want it.</p>
                                        <p>For the women and men who drive with Uber, our app
                                            represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities,
                                            we help strengthen local economies, improve access to
                                            transportation, and make streets safer.</p>
                                        <p>And that‚Äôs just what we‚Äôre doing today. We‚Äôre thinking

                                        <p>&nbsp;We‚Äôre changing the way people think about
                                            transportation. Not that long ago we were just an app to
                                            request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas.
                                            Now we‚Äôre a part of the logistical fabric of more than
                                            600 cities around the world. Whether it‚Äôs a ride, a
                                            sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people
                                            what they want, when they want it.</p>

                                        <p>For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a
                                            flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help
                                            strengthen local economies, improve access to
                                            transportation, and make streets safer.</p>

                                        <p>And that‚Äôs just what we‚Äôre doing today. We‚Äôre thinking
                                            about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous
                                            trucking and self-driving cars, we‚Äôre in for the long

                                            have knowledge of how a RESTful web service works, what
                                            makes it RESTful and how it can be accessed from
                                            Android. You are also diligent about meeting allocated
                                            budgets and can work within time constraints, but you
                                            will never sacrifice quality.</p>
